## Enabling Hardware Profile for NVIDIA GPUs
Once the [GPUs are enabled correctly in the OpenShift cluster](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.25/html/working_with_accelerators/enabling-nvidia-gpus_accelerators), the next step is configure the Hardware Profile in the RHOAI(it is hidden by default in RHOAI 2.x)
